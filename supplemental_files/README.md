This folder contains all the supplemental files of the manuscript as follows.

Supplemental File 1: Functional annotation of Pst-104E protein coding genes
Tab separated list of gene IDs followed by annotation term or accession number

Supplemental File 2: Allele pairs identified between primary contigs and haplotigs of the Pst-104E assembly
Tab separated list of gene IDs with one pairing per line followed by one of the three classifications: “Classic” alleles, alleles on non-overlapping associated haplotigs, alleles on non-associated haplotigs. See Figures S2 for illustration of these allele classifications.

Supplemental File 3: Non-allelic inter-haplome paralogs of the Pst-104E assembly
List of gene IDs that we identified as non-allelic inter-haplome paralogs.

Supplemental File 4: Unphased gene loci on primary contigs of the Pst-104E assembly
List of gene IDs that we identified as being unphased based on primary contigs after coverage analysis of Illumina short read mapping data. 

Supplemental File 5: Singletons of the Pst-104E assembly
List of gene IDs that we identified as singletons as these lack inter-haplome alleles and paralogs. 

Supplemental File 6: EffectorP predicted effector candidates of the Pst-104E assembly
List of gene IDs that we identified as candidate effectors using the machine learning approach EffectorP.

Supplemental File 7: Expression pattern of the Pst-104E secretome
Tab separated list of gene IDs followed by their expression cluster as shown in Figure 4.

Supplemental File 8: Non-redundant list of candidate effectors of the Pst-104E assembly
List of gene IDs of all candidate on primary contigs and haplotig effector candidate singletons.

Supplemental File 9: Parameters of the FALCON assembly pipeline used for the Pst-104E assembly

Supplemental File 10: Parameters of the FALCON-Unzip processing of the Pst-104E assembly

Supplemental File 11: Parameters of the REPET Tedenovo repeat prediction of the Pst-104E assembly

Supplemental File 12: Parameters of the REPET Teanno repeat prediction of the Pst-104E assembly

Supplemental File 13: Parameters of EvidenceModeler to unify gene predictions of the Pst-104E assembly

Supplemental File 14: Parameters of PASA pipeline to map de novo transcripts on the Pst-104E assembly
