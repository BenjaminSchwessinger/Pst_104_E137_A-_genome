These are all the notebooks described in the method section of the manuscript. Most are pure python while other a using more notebook features.

#####
These notebooks were only designed for the purpose of analyzing the Pst-104E genome. No gurantees they work i
n any other situtation. Those will have spelling errors due to the lack of autocorrection. Overall I think it is better to put your analysis
up even though it is not perfect instead of hiding it away on requests. Not everything in those notebooks is perfect. It should enable people to 
reproduce (most) of the analysis done in the manuscript. Just raise an issue if you see one.
