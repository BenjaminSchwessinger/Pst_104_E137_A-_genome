Rust secretomes were predicted as follows:

A protein is predicted as secreted if:

1) it has a predicted signal peptide using SignalP-NN 3.0
2) it has a TargetP localization prediction of “secreted” or “unknown” (with no restriction on the RC score) 
3) it has no transmembrane domains outside the signal peptide region (TMHMM 2.0)

This is the procedure recommended in "Evaluation of Secretion Prediction Highlights Differing Approaches Needed for Oomycete and Fungal Effectors (http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpls.2015.01168/full), which is optimized for sensitivity in recovering fungal effectors.

For comparison with other fungal secretomes, I have included the Figure from the Frontiers paper:
